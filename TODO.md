# AiNet-SNL: End-to-End Training of Iterative Reconstruction and Deep Neural Network Regularization for Sparse-Data XPCI CT

### Todo
- [ ] Install CUDA on Github.
- [ ] Add the torch_radon package to requirements.txt:
    git+git://github.com/matteo-ronchetti/torch-radon@master.
    It requires CUDA to run.
- [ ] Run unit tests for training and inference. See test_train_loop.py. They require CUDA and torch_radon to run.
